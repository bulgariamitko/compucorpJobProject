## Summery

Music has always been my passion. When I was little I always wanted to find with ease my favourite artists and theirs  discographies. So, I was very excited when Compucorp gave me the opportunity to show my skills and build this site/app for them.

## How i created the app
- sudo yo angular
- sudo npm install -g generator-karma (if needed)

## To start the app
- `grunt serve`

## Libraries/Tools i used
- AngularJS 1.6
- Boostrap (only the Modal part)
- Gulp
- Bower
- NPM

## Not sure if you find your song? Play it!
I added a functionality when someone click on an album of an artists and list all the songs with there duration to be able to play 30 seconds from the song. Any song. I think this is a nice addition to the project.

## Conclusion
Keep in mind that the code is not perfect and that it could be written better. There is always something you can do/write better. I'm happy with my final project i hope you will like it too. 

### Requirements
- Your solution must follow the design as closely as possible
- Write tests for you code
- Include a build process
- Do not use any scaffolding tool, application boilerplate or seed project
- Do not use any CSS framework (i.e. Bootstrap, Foundation, or similar)
- Use a CSS preprocessor
- The site must work fine with the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge and IE11
- Include a README file in which you explain your solution

### Additional instructions
- Use of design patterns would be a plus
- Use of JS modules would be a plus
- Use of caching and local storage would be a plus
- You may use libraries such as icon packs (font-awesome etc)
- Make your best judgement on font files
- Add anything else that could make us say wow!
