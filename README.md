## Summery

Music have been always my passion. I always wanted when i was little to be able to find with ease my favourite artists and there discographies. So, i was very exited when Compucorp have me the opportunity to show my skills and build this site/app for them.

## How i created the app
- sudo yo angular
- sudo npm install -g generator-karma (if needed)

## To start the app
- `grunt serve`

## Libraries/Tools i used
- AngularJS 1.6
- Boostrap (only the Modal part)
- Gulp
- Bower
- NPM

## Not sure if you find your song? Play it!
I added a functionality when someone click on an album of an artists and list all the songs with there duration to be able to play 30 seconds from the song. Any song. I think this is a nice addition to the project.

## Conclusion
Keep in mind that the code is not perfect and that it could be written better. There is always something you can do/write better. I'm happy with my final project i hope you will like it too.
